<h2>Get Their Attention</h2>
</div>
<p>At the top of your page, state what your company can do for the customer. Why are you the best? Why should the customer use your services? What makes you so special? Why should the customer buy your goods or use your services? Make these reasons clear from the start and at the top.</p>
</div>
  
<div id= "contact" >
<div class = "heading">
<h2>Let's Make Contact</h2>
</div>
<p>Don't make the customer have to search for contact information. That's a great way to kill a sale, not create one. Make sure your contact information is easy to find. Have your address, phone number, fax number, e-mail address and link at the top and the bottom of every page.</p>
</div>
  
<div id="picture">
<div class = "heading">
<h2>Get the Picture</h2>
</div>
<p>Photos should be the right size (not more than 3 inches by 3 inches) and not be distorted. Your photos should not look like a fun house mirror. Background graphics should contrast with, not compete with, text. If you have a lot of photos, create thumbnail images (about 1 - 1 1/2 inches square) that link to larger-size images. Having the large images on separate pages means your home page will download faster. Also, pages with several large photos and little text look quite "old school" and amateurish – it looks as if you've got nothing to say, and that's the last thing you want to convey to your readers.</p>

<div class = "heading">
<h2>How Will You Compete?</h2>
</div>
<p>Decide early on how you will differentiate yourself from others — price, selection, expertise, market niche, uniqueness, speed of delivery, unique knowledge of the subject matter — all of these aspects are important in starting a business and staying in business. For more information, we invite you to visit our office Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m.</p>
